Testing Procedure

Aug 29, 2019

The initial testing will simply be a test of the new dbp-etl against the old lptsmanager.

There are multiple ways to do a comparison of the two runs.
1. general_log.argument contains the SQL statement, and can be compared.
2. select of specific tables and columns with order by can be done and compared.

If I am rerunning the same test, using 1. would require a delete of general_log before each run.
However, I can do a repeat of 2. without rerunning.

Can I use a single database for both dbp-etl and lptsmanager?

How would I run both on the same machine?

Prepare database:
1. Load full database.
2. Truncate large tables that will not affect result.
3. Do mysqldump of result, save both loads

Run lptsmanager
1. Load abbreviated database
2. truncate general_log
2. Run 10 records
3. select general_log into a file
4. select from affected tables and columns, use order by
5. store these in an lpts_output directory

Run dbp-elt
1. Perform all of the same steps, but store output in output

Rerun dbp-elt
1. Do not reload database
1. truncate general_log
2. Run same 10 records
3. Repeat all the same steps
