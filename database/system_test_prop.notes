# This script is used to remove S3 data and DBP data in order to put S3 and DBP in a consistent state
# so that a test can be done with repeatable results.


1) One failed fileset for each type.
2) One successful fileset for each type, with no upload and no update
3) One successful fileset for each type with partial upload and partial update
4) One successful fileset for each type with complete upload and complete update
5) For video must have fileset with Transcode partially or fully deleted.
6) Video must be done separately 
7) How do I combine filesets.

ToDo

a) identify filesets for each case
b) prepare deletion scripts for each that requires removed from s3
c) prepare deletion scripts for each that requires removed from dbp
d) prepare scripts to modify LPTS fields.
