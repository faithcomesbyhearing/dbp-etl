Physical Design Database Admin Notes:

table bibles
1) Primary key has a redundant index
UNIQUE KEY `bibles_id_unique` (`id`) - is redundant the primary key has already created an index
2) Secondary indexes might be useful, but the three indexes appear to have been created one for each constraint,
which was not necessary.  Their presence does slow insertion.
2a) I doubt that queries are ever done on this table by script or numeral_systems, but they will occur by
language_id.
3) the three constraints are marked ON DELETE CASCADE, ON UPDATE CASCADE. This means that if rows in
the languages, alphabets, and numeral_systems tables are deleted, the bibles will be deleted.
The correct constraint is ON DELETE RESTRICT, ON UPDATE RESTRICT (which is also th default when no restriction is listed)

table bible_translations
1) there is no redundant index on the primary key
2) there are two indexes on foreign key values: language_id, bible_id.  These are both likely search values and are good keys.
3) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE is correct for the foreign key to bibles.  It means that the deletion of a bible will 
delete the bible_translations
4) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE is not correct for the languages foreig key, that should be changed to RESTRICT.
5) Because bible_translations has no unique key other than the auto-generated id, there are 14 duplicated records in the table.
The table needs a unique index to prevent this, but I don't know what the index should be

table bible_filesets
1) there is already a primary key on hash_id.  The second key is redundant
  KEY `bible_filesets_hash_id_index` (`hash_id`),
2) There is already a unique key where id is first.  The key on id alone is redundant.
  KEY `bible_filesets_id_index` (`id`),
3) The unique key is very important
  UNIQUE KEY `unique_prefix_for_s3` (`id`,`asset_id`,`set_type_code`),
4) the non-unique key might be valuable, but they seem to have been created to simply correspond to each foreigh key
  KEY `bible_filesets_bucket_id_foreign` (`asset_id`),
  KEY `bible_filesets_set_type_code_foreign` (`set_type_code`),
  KEY `bible_filesets_set_size_code_foreign` (`set_size_code`),
5) all of the foregin keys should be changed from CASCADE to RESTRICT.  The current state means that whenever a row is deleted
from tables: assets, bible_fileset_sizes, bible_fileset_types rows in this table will be deleted
